			<h2> Modern Times</h2>
			<p> The Iipay Nation of Santa Ysabel currently has approximately 300 enrolled members and looks forward to developing a brighter future through economic development, opportunities to pursue higher education, improved and affordable housing, cultural, language, and arts preservation, and improvements in the physical and environmental health of the Nation and land to make a better life for all Iipay. The hardships our ancestors endured help make us the strong, proud Iipay Nation we are today. After attempting to recover from a failed casino and $50 million dollars of debt in late 2014, Santa Ysabel began developing a plan and joined the cannabis Industry in early 2015. Subsequently after the memorandums were published by the Department of Justice, Santa Ysabel’s tribal leaders quietly gathered. They created laws regulating cannabis on the reservation and established the Santa Ysabel Cannabis Regulatory Agency and Cannabis Commission to oversee this risky venture. Santa Ysabel transformed their once abandoned casino into a high-tech medical cannabis operation. They are leasing part of the property to growers who cultivate, distribute, and lab-test cannabis for legal dispensaries throughout the state.

			<h2>Past & History</h2>
			<p>
				Historically, the area surrounding the Santa Ysabel Valley was known by the Indian name “Ellykwanan.” The original inhabitants who lived in the Santa Ysabel village called themselves “Iipay,” “the People.” The Iipay are part of the larger Kumeyaay people that once populated much of the geographic area of present day San Diego County. The Iipay of “Ellykwanan” lived in the general vicinity of the Santa Ysabel Valley as well as the villages of Mataguay and San Felipe near S-2. The Iipay were governed by a “Kuseyaay” or “Captain” who managed the religious, political and economic life of the people as well as trade relations with other tribes.
				The Santa Ysabel Patent to create the Reservation was signed by Executive Order on February 10, 1893 by Benjamin Harrison, then President of the United States. The villages of Ellykwanan, Mataguay, and San Felipe along with Tekemuk, —-, and —- would be combined to comprise Tracts 1, 2, and 3 of the Santa Ysabel Reservation and would make up the population of the Santa Ysabel Band of Mission (Diegueno) Indians, the name by which the Tribe is most commonly known.
